We have convolutional neural network that classifies whether we have a vehicle or not.

- For this we have kept 8 layers, and we have a dataset of approx 1500 images.
- test and train dataset are divided from the original dataset with 1200 train images, 300 test images.
- We train our CNN model based on this train images.
- After testing, we obtain around 91% accuracy, which is a pretty nice compared to the method of haar features.

Setup:
1) Install keras
2) Install opencv
3) Install tensorflow
4) Execute

Execute:
python CNN_vehicle.py
